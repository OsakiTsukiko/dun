                > Hello! I‚Äôm OsakiTsukiko, a student in high school. This project started as a school project but so far I'm enjoying it quite a lot and want to turn it into a complete game. This blog will follow the journey of this game and go into the development process.<br>

                <y class="subtitle">Game Engine</y> > Altho I‚Äôd love to write my own custom engine from scratch, I don't have the time and knowledge for that at the moment, thus I settled on Godot.  Some of the reasons I chose Godot over something like Unity are:<br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>The size of the engine, Godot is very light (~700MB), and can be easily downloaded and run on different devices, but it's still powerful enough for large games.</li>
                    <li>The License.  Godot is open source under the MIT license and you can easily edit the source code and customize the engine to your liking.</li>
                    <li>Very good compatibility with Linux (unlike Unity).</li>
                </ul>

                <y class="subtitle">What is DUN</y> > Dun is a game I'm working on (as stated above) that first started as a school project. Dun is also a project that is meant to help me better my game dev skills and programming skills in general.  I have little prior game dev experience and this will be my first ‚Äúbig game‚Äù (if I ever finish it üíÄ).  It may be quite an ambitious project for a first big project, but I believe one learns best when challenged with something that seems borderline impossible.  So far it's been quite the journey, and I‚Äôve learned a lot of stuff, but it's been going better than I anticipated.  
                <br><br>As a game, Dun will be a survival game, inspired a bit by Do Not Starve Together (one of my favorite games of all time), mainly in design and layout (camera layout). As of right now, I am not entirely sure if to make it into a pixel art game or a normal 2d game, but I'm tending to choose pixel art as I'm not that good with digital drawing and pixel art might be faster.
